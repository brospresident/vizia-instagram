# Getting Started

All of the modules in the Vizia for Developers ecosystem are available from Brandwatch's NPM Enterprise (`npme`) instance. `npme` works exactly the same as normal `npm`, but is private and thus needs authentication.

The first step in building your first app is to get authenticated with `npme`.


## working with Brandwatch's npme instance

First you'll need to log in to `npme`. You should have received the credentials from your Brandwatch contact. Once these are in hand, from your CLI execute:

`npm login --registry=https://artifactory.brandwatch.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm`

and follow the prompts.

Once this has been done, all that remains is to associate the `@vizia` package scope to the Brandwatch `npme` instance, which is accomplised via:

`npm config set @vizia:registry https://artifactory.brandwatch.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm`

That's it! You're all set to install any packages from the Vizia for Developers ecosystem. Let's take a look at [a simple app](simple-contrived.md)
