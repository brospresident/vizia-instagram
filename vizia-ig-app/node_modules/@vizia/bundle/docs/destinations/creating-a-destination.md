# Creating a Destination

Destinations are expressed as JavaScript modules that export an object with a `destination` property:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
    destination: (data, pipeline) => {
        // do something with the data
        console.log('received data!', data);

        // signal we're done consuming the data
        pipeline.done();
    }
}
```

The `pipeline.config` property can be used to get the selector of the DOM element that the Destination
will be rendered to.

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
    destination: (data, pipeline) => {
        const el = document.querySelector(pipeline.config.destTarget);

        el.innerHtml = `<div>${JSON.stringify(data)}</div>`;

        // signal we're done consuming the data
        pipeline.done();
    }
}
```

Note that the destination API is very similar to that of `Transform`. The same guidelines apply.

## The Pipeline object

| done  | Function  | A function with no arguments, used to signal that the destination is done rendering this chunk of data  |
| error  | Function  | A function with a single argument, `error`, that signals an error occurrence that cannot be recovered from. |
