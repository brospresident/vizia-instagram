# Config

Any non-trivial App will be of much more use in Vizia if the Vizia admin user is able to configure it.
For example, an App designed to pull data from a Google spreadsheet will need the spreadsheet id, an access
token to access the spreadsheet data from Google's API, and potentially additional config such as which cell(s)
to access data from.

Configuration of apps takes place in Vizia admin, and the app instance is supplied a config object at runtime,
when the `load()` method is called on it.

The config object contains a mixture of user-land configuration. There is some metadata,
such as the timezone and locale of the Vizia Project that the app is part of, and additional
data that is supplied from Vizia admin, based on the requirements of your app.

## Example config object

```JavaScript
{
    /**
     * DOM selector for bundle injection.
     * Supplied by Vizia.
     */
    destTarget: '#bundle-container',

    /**
     * Tile scene config.
     * Supplied by Vizia.
     */
    scene: {
        /**
         * Config set by the user's option controls.
         * Supplied by Vizia.
         */
        options: {
            tokens: {
                google: "{google access token}"
            },
            foo: 'some userland config'
        }
    },

    /**
     * Global installation / environment config.
     * Supplied by Vizia.
     */
    locale: 'en-GB',
    timezone: 'Europe/London'
}
```

There are some important things to note in the structure of this Object:

1. All config specific to your app will live under the `scene.options` property.
   > You can define what goes in `scene.options` and define the generated interface to fill those options under the `manifest.json`. See the [manifest docs](manifest.md) for more information.
2. `destTarget` is a string element selector for the DOM element where your App will be injected, so you can access it within your App code.
