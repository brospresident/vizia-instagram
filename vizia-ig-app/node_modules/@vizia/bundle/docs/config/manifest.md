# manifest.json

A Vizia app must have a `manifest.json` under the `public/` directory.
`manifest.json` tells Vizia all the required information about the app in order for it to be loaded properly.

Below is a pretty barebones example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "describedBy": "http://vizia.brandwatch.com/manifest/v2",
  "app": "https://your-app-bundle-location.com/bundle.js",
  "name": "your-bundle-name",
  "options": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "customValue": {
        "ui:widget": "input",
        "title": "Custom Value",
        "type": "string",
      }
    }
  },
  "browserScripts": [
    "https://example.cdn/some-dependency.js"
  ]
}
```

> If you've used `mrbundle` to generate the app boilerplate, then most of these have already been filled in for you.

## Editable Properties
