## How oAuth is supported in Vizia

When a user sets up your app, part of the admin interface will allow them to connect your
app to the OAuth-secured data provider. Vizia will store the access and refresh tokens
that it gets as part of this process, and make the access token available to your App
as part of the config supplied to the `load` method.

access tokens will live in the pipeline's `config.scene.options.tokens[provider name]` property.

As such, you will not need to build your own authentication code as part of your app; instead access tokens will be provided at runtime.
