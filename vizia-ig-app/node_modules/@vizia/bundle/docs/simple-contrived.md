# A simple, contrived example

Below is the code for a very simple App, built using `Bundle`. It is presented not as a template for your
consumption, but as an illustration of the most basic viable implementation of an App.

In the next section, [build your first app](build-your-first-app.md), we will discuss a better architecture,
as well as the tooling available to scaffold your app.

Before that, it is worth reviewing the code below, and optionally learning more about [sources](sources/sources-in-depth.md), [transforms](transforms/readme.md), [destinations](destinations/readme.md) and also the [Bundle API](api.md).

```JavaScript
const bundle = require('@vizia/bundle');

// A `Source` that emits an object once, before closing down.
const source = {
    source: (pipeline) => { // this is a source, because of this named property
        pipeline.push({value: 100}); // emit object
        pipeline.done(); // close, ie signal that there is no more data
    }
};

const multiplyTransform = {
    transform: (data, pipeline) => { // this is a transform, because of this named property
        const {multiplier} = pipeline.config; // get a value from config
        pipeline.push({value: data.value * multiplier}); // transform the data we received
        pipeline.done(); // signal that we're done
    }
}

const logDestination = {
    destination: (data, pipeline) => {  // this is a destination, because of this named property
        console.log(`received data with value: ${data.value}`); // log the data to the console
        pipeline.done(); // signal that we're done
    }
}

// use the modules from above. The order of `use` statements is significant
bundle.use(source);
bundle.use(multiplyTransform);
bundle.use(logDestination);

// export the app, to be consumed by Vizia
module.exports = bundle;
```
